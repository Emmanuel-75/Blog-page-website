                    I'm a computer science student working towards
                    becoming a front-end security engineer. My current skills
                    span HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, with a focus
                    on building clean, responsive applications. Beyond development,
                    I'm training myself to think like an engineer -- designing systems
                    that are scalable, reliable, and impactful. I'm eager to contribute,
                    learn, and grow in environments where solving real-world problems with
                    technology is the standard.

                <p>
                I'll be honest: I've struggled with being inconsistent in my tech journey🫠.
                I've always dreamed of becoming a highly-skilled Front-End Engineer, but I never
                built the structure or focus to make it happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                So, I'm starting over. This time, I'm doing it with intention. <button class="read-more">...read more</button>

                Starting this week, I'll be posting a Weekly Progress Report every Saturday 📅 .
                I thought about posting daily, but I don't want to spam anyone's feed. The plan
                is to track my progress privately each day, and then every Saturday, I'll share
                a structured summary of what I learned, built, and improved.

                For me, this is about more than just code. It's about rebuilding my consistency,

               <h3>🚀 WEEKLY RECAP #1 — Understanding How the Web Actually Works</h3>
                <p>
                Week one down! As promised, here’s my first weekly recap — partly for public
                accountability, but mostly to build consistency and momentum in my web
                development journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                This week, I didn’t write a single line of code. Instead, I went back to the
                roots — learning how the web itself works. <br>
                <br>
                Here’s what I covered 👇<button class="read-more">...read more</button>
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                1️⃣ Core Web Concepts — Revisited clients, servers, TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP — and
                how they interact to deliver a web page.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                2️⃣ What Happens When You Visit a Website — Learned that every website lives at
                an IP address (its real home), but DNS exists so we can use readable names like
                example.com instead of long numeric strings.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                3️⃣ HTTP Fundamentals — Broke down how browsers send requests and receive
                responses, and what those familiar status codes (200, 301, 403, 404, 503)
                actually mean.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                4️⃣ URL Anatomy — Understood how each part of a URL contributes to locating and
                accessing a web resource.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                5️⃣ Rendering — Learned how a browser assembles multiple packets from a server
                and turns them into a complete, viewable web page.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                This was a simplified overview, but it gave me a solid mental map of how
                everything connects.
                <br>
                ---
                <br>
                💭 Reflection What stood out most: understanding DNS — realizing the internet
                isn’t magic, just systems communicating through precise protocols (like HTTP and
                HTTPS).
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                ⏭️ Next Week I’ll be diving into HTML — learning to structure web pages from
                scratch and exploring accessibility so I can build websites that are usable by
                everyone, regardless of ability or condition.

                <h3>🚀 WEEKLY RECAP #2 — Building Accessible Web Foundations</h3>
                <p>
                Week two was about hands-on structure — learning how to build web pages the
                right way, not just the fast way. After mapping out how the web works last week,
                I shifted gears to HTML5 semantics and accessibility — the backbone of every
                solid website.
                <br>
                Here’s what I worked on 👇 <button class="read-more">...read more</button>
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                1️⃣ HTML5 Semantic Elements — Studied the purpose of tags like &lt;header&gt;,
                &lt;main&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and
                &lt;p&gt; — and how they give meaning to content for both users and screen
                readers.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                2️⃣ Accessible Design Thinking — Learned how accessibility isn’t just about
                compliance — it’s about empathy. I explored how visually impaired users navigate
                the web, and why semantics + ARIA roles matter.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                3️⃣ ARIA Labels and Roles — Understood how aria-label, aria-labelledby, and
                aria-describedby help bridge the gap when semantics alone aren’t enough.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                4️⃣ Keyboard Navigation — Tested how tab order, focus states, and skip links
                affect real usability.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                5️⃣ Practical Exercise — Built a small dummy page “Knowledge Hub” using semantic
                structure and accessibility practices — ensuring every tag had a purpose, not
                just a style.
                <br>
                💭 Reflection <br>
                This week reshaped how I view front-end development. Accessibility isn’t a
                feature — it’s a responsibility. Code isn’t truly clean unless it’s inclusive.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                ⏩Moving into forms, validation, meta tags, and SEO — bridging structure with
                interactivity and visibility.

                <h3>🚀 WEEKLY RECAP #3 — Form Validation, Meta Tags & SEO</h3>
                <p>
                Week three down! As promised, here’s my weekly recap — documenting not just what
                I’m learning, but how my understanding of front-end development keeps evolving.
                This week’s deep dive hit differently. I expected form validation to be tough,
                but meta tags and SEO opened a whole new layer — they showed me that a website
                doesn’t just have to work, it has to communicate clearly with both humans and
                algorithms.
                <br>
                Here’s what I covered <button class="read-more">...read more</button>
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                1️⃣ Form Validation: Learned that HTML5 gives you built-in validation, but real
                control starts when you combine it with JavaScript. I practiced using required,
                pattern, and type for instant feedback, created custom error messages that guide
                (not frustrate), and added accessibility tweaks, because not everyone
                experiences forms the same way. Form validation isn’t about restriction — it’s
                about respecting user input.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                2️⃣ Meta Tags: Realized meta tags are like silent negotiators between your page,
                browser, and search engines. I learnt that: <​meta charset="UTF-8"> prevents
                display glitches, <​meta name="viewport"> keeps your layout responsive, <​meta
                name="description"> shapes how your page appears on Google, and canonical + Open
                Graph tags keep SEO clean and previews consistent across platforms.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                3️⃣ SEO Basics: Good SEO isn’t about tricking search engines; it’s about
                clarity. A clean structure → search engines can read/crawl the site better.
                Descriptive titles & meta → better indexing meaning search engines are able to
                categorize the site accurately. Mobile optimization → better user
                retention/engagement.
                </p>
                <p class="More-details">
                💭 Reflection <br>
                 Learning these three together changed how I think about web development. A
                 great site doesn’t just exist for people — it has to communicate effectively
                 with browsers, bots, and devices all at once. <br>
                ⏭️ Next Week <br>
                 I’ll be combining everything I’ve learned form validation, accessibility, and
                 SEO into one clean demo page to test how all three connect in real-world
                 development. <br>
